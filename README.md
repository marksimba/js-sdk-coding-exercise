# js-sdk-coding-exercise

This small project can be thought of as the following.

There are 2 main sections.

1. A utility function to run a semi-complex set of async tasks - that needs to be implemented. See tests for functional behavior.
2. An api that can be used to log a user in. (also see tests)

This is not a fully-functional project, but imagine receiving this work as a task to complete. Review and make changes that you think should happen to clean up the codebase, make functional, and demonstrate a maintainable project.

Some things to consider

1. Try not to put too much time into this project (couple hours?) - consider documenting what you _would_ do if more time was allocated.
2. Use git branch(s) to complete the work so we can talk through the journey.
3. Feel free to make wide-sweeping changes/decisions to improve the project
4. Warning: There some "bad practices" and "bad code" so clean it up, or question what you notice and we can review during our interview.
